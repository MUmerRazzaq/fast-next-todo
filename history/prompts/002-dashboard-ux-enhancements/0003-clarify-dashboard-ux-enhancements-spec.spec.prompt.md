**Specification Coverage Summary:**

| Category | Status |
|---|---|
| Functional Scope & Behavior | Clear |
| Domain & Data Model | Resolved |
| Interaction & UX Flow | Resolved |
| Non-Functional Quality Attributes | Resolved |
| Integration & External Dependencies | Resolved |
| Edge Cases & Failure Handling | Resolved |
| Constraints & Tradeoffs | Clear |

The specification is now sufficiently detailed. The remaining edge cases can be addressed during implementation.

The recommended next step is to proceed with architectural planning.

**Suggested next command:** `/sp.plan`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - resolved 5 key ambiguities in the spec, unblocking planning.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run.
- 📁 Files: Updated the feature specification.
- 🔁 Next prompts: [/sp.plan]
- 🧠 Reflection: The sequential questioning flow worked well to incrementally build a more robust spec. Recommending options saved user effort.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
