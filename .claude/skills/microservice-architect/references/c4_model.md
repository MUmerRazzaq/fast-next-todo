# C4 Model for Visualizing Architecture

The C4 model provides a way to describe software architecture at different levels of detail.

- **Level 1: System Context Diagram**: Shows the system in its environment with users and other systems it interacts with.
- **Level 2: Container Diagram**: Zooms into the system and shows the high-level building blocks (containers). A container is something deployable like a web application, API, or database.
- **Level 3: Component Diagram**: Zooms into a container to show its components. A component is a logical grouping of related functionality.
- **Level 4: Code Diagram**: Zooms into a component to show the code-level implementation (classes, functions). This level is optional.

Use tools like Structurizr, PlantUML, or Mermaid.js to create C4 diagrams.
